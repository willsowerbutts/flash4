FLASH4 (c) 2014-05-28 William R Sowerbutts <will@sowerbutts.com>

This is an in-system flash ROM reprogrammer for the N8VEM Mark IV SBC.
Builds under Linux using:
 - SDCC (I use version 3.3.2)
 - SRecord (I use version 1.58)

You may need to adjust the path to the SDCC libraries in the Makefile if your
sdcc installation is not in /usr/local
